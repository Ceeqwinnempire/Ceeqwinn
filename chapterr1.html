const chapter_en = `📘 CHAPTER 1 – “BETA TIMES AHEAD”

I was writing like the ceiling had 5 seconds to fall. Pen dragging across sparkly squared lines like I was attacking the paper. Click. Swipe. Scribble. My brooch blinking. My heart? Matching the rhythm like they could sense the end times.
Brooch? Check. Signature? Looking like I slashed my name with a sword. Vest and blouse? Tension combo. Like softness and stress had entered a tag-team match on my torso.
Even my flats were clenching.
Then? BOOM.
The hallway exploded.
Chairs squealed. Voices ping-ponged. Somebody yelled, “OMOOO!” like they just saw an ancestral ghost wearing Crocs.
I didn’t flinch. I tucked the curl behind my ear — the disrespectful one that always slithered out when things got dramatic. 
“Beta times ahead!”
The Director’s voice slammed through the room like he was trying to shake the floor tiles into repentance.
His kaftan shimmered like a solar eclipse. Crest golden. Eyes serious. Aura? Presidential meets prophet.
“Better times ahead!” he repeated, louder now, like the roof needed to hear it too.
I gave him side-eye lite. His face? A full suspense trailer with no subtitles.
“Thank God,” I muttered, sliding my stack of rainbow files to his side like I was handing him baby dragons.
“Give Him glory,” he replied, smiling like he just approved a destiny.
The man looked like ambition had gone for NYSC, came back, and opened a tech church. Kaftan razor-clean. Placket so calm it looked like it meditated. Movements like he had nowhere to go but still controlled the schedule.
He opened the drawer. One click.
Out came the card.
Gold. Flat. Deadly.
If thunder joined a boy band and became an accessory — this was it.
The Envepad.
Not just tech. It was status. Proof. Protection. A digital guardian angel with Wi-Fi.
My brooch flickered like it just saw its long-lost sibling.
I reached—
And that’s when it happened.
The noise. The rumble.
Outside? Full chaos mode. Voices? Louder than bargain-day in Yaba. Sounds like someone summoned extra wahala with Bluetooth connection.
The Director didn’t even blink.
“Your moment has come,” he said, sliding the Envepad into my hand like he just handed me the Infinity Gauntlet.
“The school is watching.”
Then he went back to reading files like he didn’t just give me a pass to destiny.
I stared at it.
The Envepad.
Inside: My future. My rank. My proof I belonged.
But before I could even hold a full breath—
RUMMMMBBLLEE.
The hallway sounded like thunder discovered Spotify.
I didn’t panic. I adjusted my collar.
Let them come.
________________________________________
The moment I stepped out the office—
A hand snatched me like I was the last jollof rice at a party.
"CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!"
Angel Okon.
She came with sparkles. And danger. And perfume that could trigger fire alarms.
Anime sleeves flaring like she was about to cast a spell. High-waisted skirt doing the most. Beads rattling like her own sound effects team.
She didn’t walk. She ARRIVED. With vibes.
“Angel—what is it this time?” I asked, already regretting every decision that led me to this hallway.
She twirled. Then twirled again. Like a storm with glitter.
“YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT!” she gasped. Eyes wide like she saw school fees quadruple.
“What?”
She did one final spin for dramatic tension.
“THE BETAS!! THEY’RE PLAYING WARRRR IN BETA HALL!!”
I blinked. “You’re not even supposed to be—”
“I KNOW!!” she shrieked, full Gen Z hysteria activated. “But the scanner let me pass! It was the brooch! It blinked!”
She shoved it under my nose.
Silver. Flashy. Brooch the size of ambition.
“Emmanuel said I could borrow it. Just once,” she whispered. “To feel... elite-adjacent.”
I sighed. The brooch practically screamed Beta Hall access.
She yanked me like my arm owed her explanations.
I let her drag me.
Because Beta Hall? Was wide open.
Normally it was locked like family secrets. But today? The glass doors were open like drama had RSVP’d.
A crowd had gathered— staff, juniors, Essentials, one janitor who was definitely not mopping.
Cheering. Screaming. Losing their minds like it was a celebrity wedding.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!” “CHYZYLYN IS FIGHTING IN HEELS!”
Even a drone hovered, catching the madness like it was a Netflix special.
Guards? Missing. Maybe hiding. Maybe praying.
Angel grinned like chaos owed her rent money.
“Let’s go na! Before they change their mind!”
I looked at the scanner beside the door.
Green. Still green. My brooch blinked softly.
No alarms. No rejection. Just that soft, silent permission.
Like Alterborne itself said: Let her in. She’s part of this madness.
I stepped forward. Beside Angel. Into the wild
Beta times ahead.
________________________________________
Beta Hall was wild.
The kind of wild that smelled like burnt wires, broken rules, and bold decisions. If chaos had a concert, this was the backstage pass.
A robot — six-foot-something of metal menace — lunged like it was collecting debts in instalments.
And the target?
Anderson.
Crisp black suit. Gold vest shining like he dressed for his own graduation and forgot his brain at home.
Tall. Polished. Dumb.
He squared up like fists could solve coding problems. Like he was auditioning for “Transformers: Lagos Drift.”
Students roared. Lights flashed. Laser grids danced across the ceiling like a DJ was controlling the building.
A robot dog chased a drone. The drone ran like it owed money. The dog barked in binary.
And in the eye of the storm?
One boy. One bot. One terrible idea.
Anderson ducked. The robot swung. BOOOOM.
A table flipped like it had heard enough.
Angel screamed beside me like someone paused her favorite telenovela.
“THIS IS STREET FIGHTER LEVEL 9000!!”
Me?
I sighed.
Because next to me?
Samuel Okon.
Sweater lazily tied across one shoulder. Fade sharp enough to slice yam. Aura? Smelled like sandalwood, old money, and academic judgment.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” he said.
“Yeah…” I started.
“…how the Betas always find a way to make it about them,” he finished, voice steady like tea without sugar.
And then she appeared.
Chyzylyn.
If martial arts met runway fashion in a spicy anime remix — she’d be the poster.
One thigh out. One pleat down. Boots like thunder.
Skirt? Flared like it had a personal fan. Eyes? Sharp. Movement? Slice.
She didn’t enter. She attacked.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow to the bot’s jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kicked the robot’s leg.
The crowd screamed like the group chat just dropped a leaked test.
And then—
ZzzRRT!
The robot’s red eye spun, detached mid-air like a spiritual USB stick and flew—
Straight. At. My. Face.
“CEEQWINNN DUCKKKK!!!” Angel screamed.
I didn’t duck.
I twisted.
The eye grazed my curls like it was testing my shampoo, then smacked a desk with a THUD that smelled like burnt jollof and regret.
I blinked.
Angel gasped beside me. “IF I DIE HERE, TELL MY MOTHER I DIED WITH FINE HAIR!!”
Silence.
Samuel stepped forward. Didn’t shout. Didn’t flinch.
“Envepad override,” he said, tapping his brooch. “Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
The walls responded like obedient househelps.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that…
The robot froze.
Anderson lay wheezing on the floor like he’d just fought destiny.
Chyzylyn flicked her braid like the battle didn’t touch her.
The crowd erupted into whispers.
Samuel turned to me.
“Still standing?”
“I’d rather sit,” I muttered, already falling into the nearest chair like rent was due.
His face didn’t smile. But his eyes? They smirked.
And just then—
Bulus stomped in.
Uniform? Pressed like it studied in Cambridge. Mouth? Already loaded.
“CEEQWINN. YOU’RE NOW AN ALPHALITE?”
“Better be,” Prosper chimed, flicking his designer collar like it owed him rent.
“Or a WIFE,” someone whispered.
Laughter.
Angel gasped like someone just proposed.
I reached for my Envepad—
Gone.
Brooch? Missing. Chest? Empty. Desk? Checked.
Nothing.
Angel blinked. “Didn’t you just—? Wait. What’s that?”
We turned.
The robot’s eye — now blinking like low battery — began to unfold.
Legs.
Tiny. Creepy. Mechanical.
Inside it?
My Envepad.
One hiss.
One twitch.
And the thing LAUNCHED.
Smashed through the window.
Glass shattered. Screams. Even Bulus cursed in capital letters.
I stood frozen.
Every eye in the hall turned to me.
Including the Director’s — watching silently from the camera feed above the door.
Class erupted.
Chairs flying. Voices booming.
And me?
Already running out the door.

const chapter_ng = `CHAPTER 1 – “BETA TIMES AHEAD”

I was writing like the ceiling only had five seconds left to crash down. My pen was flying across those glittery squared lines like I was fighting the paper itself. Click. Swipe. Scribble.
My brooch was blinking.
My heartbeat? Following the same rhythm — like both of them knew end times had clocked in.

Brooch? Present.
Signature? Looking like I used cutlass to carve it out.
Vest and blouse? High-tension combo — like soft fabric and serious stress were fighting over space on my body.
Even my flat shoes were holding themselves like they had tension.

Then — BOOM.
The hallway scattered.

Chairs screeched.
Voices bounced everywhere.
One person shouted “OMOOO!” like they just saw their great-grandfather’s ghost wearing Crocs.

I didn’t even blink.
I calmly tucked that one stubborn curl behind my ear — the one that always comes out to cause drama when life starts acting like a telenovela.

“Beta times ahead!”
The Director’s voice shook the room like he was trying to command the floor tiles to surrender.

His kaftan was shining like solar eclipse.
Crest golden.
Eyes sharp.
His whole presence? Like one president wey go church revival.

“Better times ahead!” he said again, even louder — like he was talking to the ceiling itself.

I gave him small side-eye.
His face? Like one suspense movie trailer without subtitles.

“Thank God,” I muttered, dragging my colourful stack of files to his side like I was handing over newborn dragons.

“Give Him glory,” he replied, smiling like he just signed off my life’s purpose.

The man looked like ambition went for NYSC, came back, and opened tech ministry.
His kaftan? Razor sharp.
The front button strip looked like it just finished morning meditation.
His movements were so calm — like someone that has nowhere urgent to go but is still in charge of everybody’s timetable.

Then he opened his drawer. One click.

Out came the card.
Gold. Flat. Deadly.

If thunder joined a boy band and turned into an accessory — this was it.

The Envepad.

Not just gadget. This one was rank.
Proof.
Cover.
A digital guardian angel wey sabi hotspot.

My brooch flickered like it just recognized long-lost family member.

I reached for it—
And that’s when everything scattered.

Noise. Vibration.
Outside? Complete pandemonium.
Voices louder than Black Friday at Balogun.
Sound? Like someone downloaded fresh wahala with Bluetooth speaker.

The Director didn’t even look up.

“Your moment has come,” he said, sliding the Envepad into my hand like he just gave me the Infinity Gauntlet.
“The school is watching.”

Then he just went back to reading his files like say he no just hand over my entire destiny.

I looked at it.
The Envepad.
Inside it: My future. My level. My proof say I belong here.

But before I could even take complete one full breath—
RUMMMMBBLLEE.

The hallway now sounded like thunder started Spotify subscription.

Still, I didn’t panic.
I adjusted my collar.
Make dem come.
________________________________________


The moment I stepped out of the office—
One hand grabbed me like I was the last scoop of jollof rice at a wedding.
“CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!”
Angel Okon.
She didn’t just show up — she came with sparkle, trouble, and perfume strong enough to set off the fire alarm.
Her anime-style sleeves were flaring like she wanted to perform magic. Her high-waisted skirt was doing too much.
And the beads on her wrist? Rattling like she came with her own personal sound effects.
Angel didn’t walk.
She arrived.
With full vibes.
“Angel, what is it again this time?” I asked, already regretting every life choice that brought me into this hallway.
She twirled.
Then she twirled again.
Like a glitter tornado with somewhere to be.
“YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT!” she gasped, eyes wide like she just saw school fees increase x4.
“What happened?”
She spun one more time — this one clearly for dramatic tension.
“THE BETAS!! THEY’RE FIGHTING IN BETA HALL!!”
I blinked. “You’re not even supposed to—”
“I KNOW!!” she screamed, full Gen Z mode activated.
“But the scanner let me pass! It was the brooch! It blinked!”
She shoved it right under my nose.
Silver. Flashy.
A brooch almost as loud as her personality.
“Emmanuel said I could borrow it. Just once,” she whispered.
“To feel... elite-adjacent.”
I sighed.
The brooch was practically screaming Beta Hall access.
Then she dragged me — like my arm owed her answers.
And I allowed her.
Because Beta Hall?
It was wide open.
Normally, it’s locked tighter than family secrets.
But today? The glass doors were flung open like drama had RSVP’d and brought extras.
A full crowd had gathered — staff, juniors, Essentials, even one janitor that clearly abandoned his mop for gist.
They were screaming. Cheering. Losing their minds like it was a celebrity wedding.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!!”
“CHYZYLYN IS FIGHTING IN HEELS!!”
Even a drone was flying overhead, recording everything like a Netflix documentary.
Guards?
Nowhere in sight.
Maybe they were hiding. Maybe they were praying.
Angel was smiling like chaos owed her rent money.
“Come na! Before they change their mind!”
I looked at the scanner beside the glass door.
Green. Still green.
My brooch blinked — soft and quiet.
No alarm. No warning. Just that subtle go-ahead.
Like Alterborne itself was saying:
Let her in. She’s part of the madness.
I stepped forward.
Beside Angel.
Into the wild.
Beta times ahead.
________________________________________


Beta Hall was on fire.
Not literal fire — but the kind of chaos that smelled like burnt wires, scattered rules, and overconfident decisions.
If confusion ever hosted a concert, this was the backstage pass.
A robot — six-foot-something of pure metal madness — lunged forward like it came to collect overdue payments in instalments.
And the target?
Anderson.
Black suit clean like waiting go wedding. Gold vest dey shine like say na him own convocation day.
But the guy brain?

E square up like say to fight robot na normal thing. Like say e wan join “Transformers: Lagos Drift.”
Student dey shout anyhow. Light dey flash like club.
Laser dey waka for ceiling like DJ dey do light show.
Robot dog dey chase drone.
The drone flew like debtor.
The dog barked in binary.
And right at the centre of the madness?
One boy.
One bot.
One terribly bad idea.
Anderson dodge. Robot swing —
BOOOOM.
Table flip like e hear wetin e no suppose hear.
Angel shout for my side like person wey dem cut cable when telenovela sweet pass.
“THIS IS STREET FIGHTER LEVEL 9000!!”
Me?
I sigh.
Because right beside me was Samuel Okon.
Sweater hanging lazily on one shoulder.
Him fade sharp like knife wey dem use slice new yam.
Aura?
E smell like sandalwood, rich pikin, and person wey dey judge you for mind.
“E sweet, abi?” he talk.
“Yeah…” I start.
“...na how Beta people sabi turn everything to drama,”
he finish am.
Voice calm like zobo wey no get sugar.
Na then she land —
Chyzylyn.
If you mix kung-fu with catwalk, add small anime pepper — na her go appear for the poster.
One thigh show. One pleat drop.
Boots loud like thunder.
Skirt dey flare like say breeze dey follow am.
Her eye? Sharp.
Movement? Na blade.
She no walk enter.
She launch attack.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow jam robot jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kick robot leg like football.
Everybody scream like person post expo for WhatsApp group.
Then—
ZzZRT!!
Robot eye — red like evil alarm — spin comot for body.
Fly like evil flash drive wey dem send from shrine.
STRRRRAIGHT. TO. MY. FACE.
“CEEQWINNN DUUUUUCKKK!!!” Angel scream.
Me no duck.
I just twist.
The eye brush my curl like say e dey check if I use better shampoo.
Then BANG!! E knock desk.
The sound smell like burnt jollof rice and mistake.
I blink.
Angel look me. Gasp like person wey hear wedding don cancel.
“IF I DIE HERE, TELL MUMMY SAY I DIE WITH FINE HAIR O!!”
Silence.
Samuel step forward. No shout. No panic.
“Envepad override,” he yarn, touch him brooch.
“Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
Wall just reply like obedient housemaid.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that...
The robot freeze.
Anderson for ground, dey breathe like say he fight dragon.
Chyzylyn just flick her braid like say nothing touch am.
Crowd begin whisper.
Samuel turn face me.
“You still dey stand?”
“Abeg I prefer to sit,” I talk, as I collapse for chair like say NEPA just cut light and rent remain unpaid.
Him face no smile.
But him eyes?
Dem chuckle small.
Na that moment —
Bulus burst enter.
Uniform iron reach PhD level.
Mouth don charge.
“CEEQWINN. YOU BE ALPHALITE NOW?!”
“E better make she be,” Prosper add, adjust him designer collar like say e wan evict am.
“Or maybe... WIFE,” somebody drop soft for back.
Laughter fly.
Angel shout like say proposal just drop.
I reach for my Envepad—
E don disappear.
Brooch? Nowhere.
Chest? Dry.
Desk? Search am.
Nothing.
Angel blink.
“But no be just now—? Wait. Wetin be dat?”
We turn.
Robot red eye — that same one — dey blink like low battery.

One hiss.
One small shake.
BWOOMMMM!!

Glass scatter. People scream.
Even Bulus curse — in full capslock.

All the eyes inside hall face me.
Even the Director, dey watch from the camera wey dey on top door.
Class don burst.
Chair dey fly.
Shout full everywhere.
And me?
I don dey run commot.

/* NIGERIAN PIDGIN version (exactly as provided) */

________________________________________


As I just waka comot from the office—
One hand grab me like say I be the last jollof rice wey remain for owambe.
"CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!"
Angel Okon.
She no just waka come — she enter with bling, wahala, and perfume wey fit wake fire alarm.
Her anime sleeve dey flare like say she wan summon thunder.
High waist skirt wey dey show say fabric fit get attitude.
Her beads? Dey jingle like say she carry personal soundtrack team.
This babe no dey walk.
She dey arrive.
With confidence and small madness.
“Angel, wetin be dis one again?” I ask, as regret begin tap me small small for back of neck.
She spin.
Then spin again.
Like say na glitter hurricane dey learn work under her.
“YOU NO GO BELIEVE WETIN I SEE!!” she gasp, eyes big like person wey just hear say fuel don reach ₦5k per litre.
“Wetin happen?”
She spin one last time, this one na finale spin, for suspense sake.
“DEM DEY FIGHT!! DEM BETA STUDENTS DEY USE BETA HALL DO WAR MOVIE!!”
I blink. “But you no even suppose—”
“I KNOWWWWW!!!” she shout like phone wey ring for silence zone.
“But the scanner gree me pass o! Na the brooch! E flash!!”
She match am for my face sharp-sharp.
Silver. Flashy.
Brooch wey big like ego.
“Na Emmanuel gimme. Just for today,” she whisper like secret agent.
“I wan feel... like say I near the elite small.”
I sigh.
The brooch just dey shout ‘Beta Access’ anyhow.
Before I talk, she don drag me.
Like say my arm na thief wey owe her explanation.
I no resist.
Because that Beta Hall? E wide open.
Normal days, dem dey lock am pass family curse.
But today? The glass door open like drama don drop invitation.
People full everywhere — staff, juniors, Essentials, even one cleaner wey forget say mop dey him hand.
Dem dey shout. Dey cheer.
Brains don fly like say na Wizkid wedding wey dey happen.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!!”
“CHYZYLYN DEY FIGHT FOR HEELS!!”
Drone sef dey fly up, dey record the whole madness like say na Netflix dey sponsor am.
Security? Dem vanish.
Maybe dem run. Maybe dem dey pray inside store.
Angel smile like say wahala na her tenant.
“Make we enter na! Before dem change their mind!”
I look the scanner by the door.
Green light. Still green.
My brooch flash small-small, like say e dey wink.
No alarm. No shout. Just that silent go-ahead.
Like Alterborne whisper say:
"Leave am. She belong for this kain madness."
I waka go front.
Side by side with Angel.
Enter chaos.
Beta times dey wait.
________________________________________


Beta Hall don mad.
I no dey talk normal madness.
I dey talk the kain madness wey dey smell like burn wire, broken school rules and bold people wey no dey fear anything.
If kasala ever organize concert, na this one be VIP backstage pass.
Na so one robot — tall pass landlord, metal full body like transformer wey vex — just charge like say e dey collect money wey people never pay finish.
Who e dey pursue?
Anderson.
Black suit clean like waiting go wedding. Gold vest dey shine like say na him own convocation day.
But the guy brain?

E square up like say to fight robot na normal thing. Like say e wan join “Transformers: Lagos Drift.”
Student dey shout anyhow. Light dey flash like club.
Laser dey waka for ceiling like DJ dey do light show.
Robot dog dey chase drone.
The drone dey fly like debtor.
Dog dey bark in computer language — “10110111-GRRRR!”
And for center of all the craze?
One boy.
One bot.
One bad idea wey no get future.
Anderson dodge. Robot swing —
BOOOOOM!!
Table flip like e hear wetin e no suppose hear.
Angel shout for my side like person wey dem cut cable when telenovela sweet pass.
“DIS ONE NA STREET FIGHTER LEVEL NINE THOUSAND!!”
Me?
I just sigh.
Because who dey beside me?
Samuel Okon.
Sweater tie anyhow for one shoulder.
Him fade sharp like knife wey dem use slice new yam.
Aura?
E smell like sandalwood, rich pikin, and person wey dey judge you for mind.
“E sweet, abi?” he talk.
“Yeah…” I start.
“...na how Beta people sabi turn everything to drama,” he complete am.
Voice calm like zobo wey no get sugar.
Na then she land —
Chyzylyn.
If you mix kung-fu with catwalk, add small anime pepper — na her go appear for the poster.
One thigh show. One pleat drop.
Boots loud like thunder.
Skirt dey flare like say breeze dey follow am.
Her eye? Sharp.
Movement? Na blade.
She no walk enter.
She launch attack.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow jam robot jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kick robot leg like football.
Everybody scream like person post expo for WhatsApp group.
Then—
ZzZRT!!
Robot eye — red like evil alarm — spin comot for body.
Fly like evil flash drive wey dem send from shrine.
STRRRRAIGHT. TO. MY. FACE.
“CEEQWINNN DUUUUUCKKK!!!” Angel scream.
Me no duck.
I just twist.
The eye brush my curl like say e dey check if I use better shampoo.
Then BANG!! E knock desk.
The sound smell like burnt jollof rice and mistake.
I blink.
Angel look me. Gasp like person wey hear wedding don cancel.
“IF I DIE HERE, TELL MUMMY SAY I DIE WITH FINE HAIR O!!”
Silence.
Samuel step forward. No shout. No panic.
“Envepad override,” he yarn, touch him brooch.
“Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
Wall just reply like obedient housemaid.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that...
The robot freeze.
Anderson for ground, dey breathe like say he fight dragon.
Chyzylyn just flick her braid like say nothing touch am.
Crowd begin whisper.
Samuel turn face me.
“You still dey stand?”
“Abeg I prefer to sit,” I talk, as I collapse for chair like say NEPA just cut light and rent remain unpaid.
Him face no smile.
But him eyes?
Dem chuckle small.
Na that moment —
Bulus burst enter.
Uniform iron reach PhD level.
Mouth don charge.
“CEEQWINN. YOU BE ALPHALITE NOW?!”
“E better make she be,” Prosper add, adjust him designer collar like say e wan evict am.
“Or maybe... WIFE,” somebody drop soft for back.
Laughter fly.
Angel shout like say proposal just drop.
I reach for my Envepad—
E don disappear.
Brooch? Nowhere.
Chest? Dry.
Desk? Search am.
Nothing.
Angel blink.
“But no be just now—? Wait. Wetin be dat?”
We turn.
Robot red eye — that same one — dey blink like low battery.
Na so e begin open...
Legs.
Small. Creepy.
Like cockroach from science lab.

My Envepad.
One hiss.
One small shake.
BWOOMMMM!!
The thing jump,
Break window scatter.
Glass scatter. People scream.
Even Bulus curse — in full capslock.
I freeze.
All the eyes inside hall face me.
Even the Director, dey watch from the camera wey dey on top door.
Class don burst.
Chair dey fly.
Shout full everywhere.
And me?
I don dey run commot.
