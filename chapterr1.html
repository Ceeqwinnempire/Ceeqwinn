[📘 CHAPTER 1 – “BETA TIMES AHEAD”

I was writing like the ceiling had 5 seconds to fall. Pen dragging across sparkly squared lines like I was attacking the paper. Click. Swipe. Scribble. My brooch blinking. My heart? Matching the rhythm like they could sense the end times.
Brooch? Check. Signature? Looking like I slashed my name with a sword. Vest and blouse? Tension combo. Like softness and stress had entered a tag-team match on my torso.
Even my flats were clenching.
Then? BOOM.
The hallway exploded.
Chairs squealed. Voices ping-ponged. Somebody yelled, “OMOOO!” like they just saw an ancestral ghost wearing Crocs.
I didn’t flinch. I tucked the curl behind my ear — the disrespectful one that always slithered out when things got dramatic. 
“Beta times ahead!”
The Director’s voice slammed through the room like he was trying to shake the floor tiles into repentance.
His kaftan shimmered like a solar eclipse. Crest golden. Eyes serious. Aura? Presidential meets prophet.
“Better times ahead!” he repeated, louder now, like the roof needed to hear it too.
I gave him side-eye lite. His face? A full suspense trailer with no subtitles.
“Thank God,” I muttered, sliding my stack of rainbow files to his side like I was handing him baby dragons.
“Give Him glory,” he replied, smiling like he just approved a destiny.
The man looked like ambition had gone for NYSC, came back, and opened a tech church. Kaftan razor-clean. Placket so calm it looked like it meditated. Movements like he had nowhere to go but still controlled the schedule.
He opened the drawer. One click.
Out came the card.
Gold. Flat. Deadly.
If thunder joined a boy band and became an accessory — this was it.
The Envepad.
Not just tech. It was status. Proof. Protection. A digital guardian angel with Wi-Fi.
My brooch flickered like it just saw its long-lost sibling.
I reached—
And that’s when it happened.
The noise. The rumble.
Outside? Full chaos mode. Voices? Louder than bargain-day in Yaba. Sounds like someone summoned extra wahala with Bluetooth connection.
The Director didn’t even blink.
“Your moment has come,” he said, sliding the Envepad into my hand like he just handed me the Infinity Gauntlet.
“The school is watching.”
Then he went back to reading files like he didn’t just give me a pass to destiny.
I stared at it.
The Envepad.
Inside: My future. My rank. My proof I belonged.
But before I could even hold a full breath—
RUMMMMBBLLEE.
The hallway sounded like thunder discovered Spotify.
I didn’t panic. I adjusted my collar.
Let them come.
________________________________________
The moment I stepped out the office—
A hand snatched me like I was the last jollof rice at a party.
"CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!"
Angel Okon.
She came with sparkles. And danger. And perfume that could trigger fire alarms.
Anime sleeves flaring like she was about to cast a spell. High-waisted skirt doing the most. Beads rattling like her own sound effects team.
She didn’t walk. She ARRIVED. With vibes.
“Angel—what is it this time?” I asked, already regretting every decision that led me to this hallway.
She twirled. Then twirled again. Like a storm with glitter.
“YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT!” she gasped. Eyes wide like she saw school fees quadruple.
“What?”
She did one final spin for dramatic tension.
“THE BETAS!! THEY’RE PLAYING WARRRR IN BETA HALL!!”
I blinked. “You’re not even supposed to be—”
“I KNOW!!” she shrieked, full Gen Z hysteria activated. “But the scanner let me pass! It was the brooch! It blinked!”
She shoved it under my nose.
Silver. Flashy. Brooch the size of ambition.
“Emmanuel said I could borrow it. Just once,” she whispered. “To feel... elite-adjacent.”
I sighed. The brooch practically screamed Beta Hall access.
She yanked me like my arm owed her explanations.
I let her drag me.
Because Beta Hall? Was wide open.
Normally it was locked like family secrets. But today? The glass doors were open like drama had RSVP’d.
A crowd had gathered— staff, juniors, Essentials, one janitor who was definitely not mopping.
Cheering. Screaming. Losing their minds like it was a celebrity wedding.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!” “CHYZYLYN IS FIGHTING IN HEELS!”
Even a drone hovered, catching the madness like it was a Netflix special.
Guards? Missing. Maybe hiding. Maybe praying.
Angel grinned like chaos owed her rent money.
“Let’s go na! Before they change their mind!”
I looked at the scanner beside the door.
Green. Still green. My brooch blinked softly.
No alarms. No rejection. Just that soft, silent permission.
Like Alterborne itself said: Let her in. She’s part of this madness.
I stepped forward. Beside Angel. Into the wild
Beta times ahead.
________________________________________

Beta Hall was wild.
The kind of wild that smelled like burnt wires, broken rules, and bold decisions. If chaos had a concert, this was the backstage pass.
A robot — six-foot-something of metal menace — lunged like it was collecting debts in instalments.
And the target?
Anderson.
Crisp black suit. Gold vest shining like he dressed for his own graduation and forgot his brain at home.
Tall. Polished. Dumb.
He squared up like fists could solve coding problems. Like he was auditioning for “Transformers: Lagos Drift.”
Students roared. Lights flashed. Laser grids danced across the ceiling like a DJ was controlling the building.
A robot dog chased a drone. The drone ran like it owed money. The dog barked in binary.
And in the eye of the storm?
One boy. One bot. One terrible idea.
Anderson ducked. The robot swung. BOOOOM.
A table flipped like it had heard enough.
Angel screamed beside me like someone paused her favorite telenovela.
“THIS IS STREET FIGHTER LEVEL 9000!!”
Me?
I sighed.
Because next to me?
Samuel Okon.
Sweater lazily tied across one shoulder. Fade sharp enough to slice yam. Aura? Smelled like sandalwood, old money, and academic judgment.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” he said.
“Yeah…” I started.
“…how the Betas always find a way to make it about them,” he finished, voice steady like tea without sugar.
And then she appeared.
Chyzylyn.
If martial arts met runway fashion in a spicy anime remix — she’d be the poster.
One thigh out. One pleat down. Boots like thunder.
Skirt? Flared like it had a personal fan. Eyes? Sharp. Movement? Slice.
She didn’t enter. She attacked.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow to the bot’s jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kicked the robot’s leg.
The crowd screamed like the group chat just dropped a leaked test.
And then—
ZzzRRT!
The robot’s red eye spun, detached mid-air like a spiritual USB stick and flew—
Straight. At. My. Face.
“CEEQWINNN DUCKKKK!!!” Angel screamed.
I didn’t duck.
I twisted.
The eye grazed my curls like it was testing my shampoo, then smacked a desk with a THUD that smelled like burnt jollof and regret.
I blinked.
Angel gasped beside me. “IF I DIE HERE, TELL MY MOTHER I DIED WITH FINE HAIR!!”
Silence.
Samuel stepped forward. Didn’t shout. Didn’t flinch.
“Envepad override,” he said, tapping his brooch. “Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
The walls responded like obedient househelps.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that…
The robot froze.
Anderson lay wheezing on the floor like he’d just fought destiny.
Chyzylyn flicked her braid like the battle didn’t touch her.
The crowd erupted into whispers.
Samuel turned to me.
“Still standing?”
“I’d rather sit,” I muttered, already falling into the nearest chair like rent was due.
His face didn’t smile. But his eyes? They smirked.
And just then—
Bulus stomped in.
Uniform? Pressed like it studied in Cambridge. Mouth? Already loaded.
“CEEQWINN. YOU’RE NOW AN ALPHALITE?”
“Better be,” Prosper chimed, flicking his designer collar like it owed him rent.
“Or a WIFE,” someone whispered.
Laughter.
Angel gasped like someone just proposed.
I reached for my Envepad—
Gone.
Brooch? Missing. Chest? Empty. Desk? Checked.
Nothing.
Angel blinked. “Didn’t you just—? Wait. What’s that?”
We turned.
The robot’s eye — now blinking like low battery — began to unfold.
Legs.
Tiny. Creepy. Mechanical.
Inside it?
My Envepad.
One hiss.
One twitch.
And the thing LAUNCHED.
Smashed through the window.
Glass shattered. Screams. Even Bulus cursed in capital letters.
I stood frozen.
Every eye in the hall turned to me.
Including the Director’s — watching silently from the camera feed above the door.
Class erupted.
Chairs flying. Voices booming.
And me?
Already running out the door.

[CHAPTER 1 – “BETA TIMES AHEAD”

I was writing like the ceiling only had five seconds left to crash down. My pen was flying across those glittery squared lines like I was fighting the paper itself. Click. Swipe. Scribble.
My brooch was blinking.
My heartbeat? Following the same rhythm — like both of them knew end times had clocked in.
Brooch? Present.
Signature? Looking like I used cutlass to carve it out.
Vest and blouse? High-tension combo — like soft fabric and serious stress were fighting over space on my body.
Even my flat shoes were holding themselves like they had tension.
Then — BOOM.
The hallway scattered.
Chairs screeched.
Voices bounced everywhere.
One person shouted “OMOOO!” like they just saw their great-grandfather’s ghost wearing Crocs.
I didn’t even blink.
I calmly tucked that one stubborn curl behind my ear — the one that always comes out to cause drama when life starts acting like a telenovela.
“Beta times ahead!”
The Director’s voice shook the room like he was trying to command the floor tiles to surrender.
His kaftan was shining like solar eclipse.
Crest golden.
Eyes sharp.
His whole presence? Like one president wey go church revival.
“Better times ahead!” he said again, even louder — like he was talking to the ceiling itself.
I gave him small side-eye.
His face? Like one suspense movie trailer without subtitles.
“Thank God,” I muttered, dragging my colourful stack of files to his side like I was handing over newborn dragons.
“Give Him glory,” he replied, smiling like he just signed off my life’s purpose.
The man looked like ambition went for NYSC, came back, and opened tech ministry.
His kaftan? Razor sharp.
The front button strip looked like it just finished morning meditation.
His movements were so calm — like someone that has nowhere urgent to go but is still in charge of everybody’s timetable.
Then he opened his drawer. One click.
Out came the card.
Gold. Flat. Deadly.
If thunder joined a boy band and turned into an accessory — this was it.
The Envepad.
Not just gadget. This one was rank.
Proof.
Cover.
A digital guardian angel wey sabi hotspot.
My brooch flickered like it just recognized long-lost family member.
I reached for it—
And that’s when everything scattered.
Noise. Vibration.
Outside? Complete pandemonium.
Voices louder than Black Friday at Balogun.
Sound? Like someone downloaded fresh wahala with Bluetooth speaker.
The Director didn’t even look up.
“Your moment has come,” he said, sliding the Envepad into my hand like he just gave me the Infinity Gauntlet.
“The school is watching.”
Then he just went back to reading his files like say he no just hand over my entire destiny.
I looked at it.
The Envepad.
Inside it: My future. My level. My proof say I belong here.
But before I could even take complete one full breath—
RUMMMMBBLLEE.
The hallway now sounded like thunder started Spotify subscription.
Still, I didn’t panic.
I adjusted my collar.
Make dem come.
________________________________________


The moment I stepped out of the office—
One hand grabbed me like I was the last scoop of jollof rice at a wedding.
“CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!”
Angel Okon.
She didn’t just show up — she came with sparkle, trouble, and perfume strong enough to set off the fire alarm.
Her anime-style sleeves were flaring like she wanted to perform magic. Her high-waisted skirt was doing too much.
And the beads on her wrist? Rattling like she came with her own personal sound effects.
Angel didn’t walk.
She arrived.
With full vibes.
“Angel, what is it again this time?” I asked, already regretting every life choice that brought me into this hallway.
She twirled.
Then she twirled again.
Like a glitter tornado with somewhere to be.
“YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT!” she gasped, eyes wide like she just saw school fees increase x4.
“What happened?”
She spun one more time — this one clearly for dramatic tension.
“THE BETAS!! THEY’RE FIGHTING IN BETA HALL!!”
I blinked. “You’re not even supposed to—”
“I KNOW!!” she screamed, full Gen Z mode activated.
“But the scanner let me pass! It was the brooch! It blinked!”
She shoved it right under my nose.
Silver. Flashy.
A brooch almost as loud as her personality.
“Emmanuel said I could borrow it. Just once,” she whispered.
“To feel... elite-adjacent.”
I sighed.
The brooch was practically screaming Beta Hall access.
Then she dragged me — like my arm owed her answers.
And I allowed her.
Because Beta Hall?
It was wide open.
Normally, it’s locked tighter than family secrets.
But today? The glass doors were flung open like drama had RSVP’d and brought extras.
A full crowd had gathered — staff, juniors, Essentials, even one janitor that clearly abandoned his mop for gist.
They were screaming. Cheering. Losing their minds like it was a celebrity wedding.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!!”
“CHYZYLYN IS FIGHTING IN HEELS!!”
Even a drone was flying overhead, recording everything like a Netflix documentary.
Guards?
Nowhere in sight.
Maybe they were hiding. Maybe they were praying.
Angel was smiling like chaos owed her rent money.
“Come na! Before they change their mind!”
I looked at the scanner beside the glass door.
Green. Still green.
My brooch blinked — soft and quiet.
No alarm. No warning. Just that subtle go-ahead.
Like Alterborne itself was saying:
Let her in. She’s part of the madness.
I stepped forward.
Beside Angel.
Into the wild.
Beta times ahead.
________________________________________


Beta Hall was on fire.
Not literal fire — but the kind of chaos that smelled like burnt wires, scattered rules, and overconfident decisions.
If confusion ever hosted a concert, this was the backstage pass.
A robot — six-foot-something of pure metal madness — lunged forward like it came to collect overdue payments in instalments.
And the target?
Anderson.
Crisp black suit. Gold vest shining like he was dressed for his graduation but left his common sense at home.
Tall. Clean. Not that bright.
He squared up like fists could solve coding issues. Like he was auditioning for Transformers: Lagos Drift.
Students were shouting. Lights were flashing.
Laser grids danced on the ceiling like a DJ was running the building from inside the walls.
A robot dog was chasing a drone.
The drone flew like it was owing money.
The dog barked in binary.
And right at the centre of the madness?
One boy.
One bot.
One terribly bad idea.
Anderson ducked. The robot swung.
BOOOOM.
A table flipped — like it had heard enough.
Angel screamed beside me like someone paused her favourite telenovela.
“THIS IS STREET FIGHTER LEVEL 9000!!”
Me?
I sighed.
Because right beside me was Samuel Okon.
Sweater hanging lazily on one shoulder.
Fade sharp enough to slice yam.
Aura? Smelled like sandalwood, old money, and someone who judged you quietly.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” he said.
“Yeah...” I started.
“...how the Betas always find a way to make everything about themselves,”
he finished, voice steady — like unsweetened tea.
And then, she appeared.
Chyzylyn.
If martial arts and fashion ever had a child inside an anime — she was the poster girl.
One thigh showing. One pleat dropped.
Boots? Thunder.
Skirt? Flared like it had a portable fan.
Eyes? Sharp.
Movement? Lethal.
She didn’t walk in.
She attacked.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow to the robot’s jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kicked the robot’s leg.
The crowd screamed like someone just dropped leaked exam papers on the group chat.
And then—
ZzZRT!
The robot’s red eye spun, popped off mid-air like a spiritual USB stick — and launched.
Straight. At. My. Face.
“CEEQWINN DUCKKKK!!!” Angel screamed.
But I didn’t duck.
I twisted.
The red eye barely grazed my curls like it was testing my shampoo brand — then slammed into a desk with a THUD that smelled like burnt jollof and regret.
I blinked.
Angel gasped beside me.
“IF I DIE HERE, TELL MY MUMMY I DIED WITH FINE HAIR!!”
Silence.
Samuel stepped forward.
He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t flinch.
“Envepad override,” he said, tapping his brooch.
“Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
The walls answered immediately, like well-trained househelps.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that—
The robot froze.
Anderson was still on the floor, breathing like he’d just fought his future.
Chyzylyn flicked her braid like the whole thing was beneath her.
The crowd?
Whispers everywhere.
Samuel turned to me.
“Still standing?”
“I’d rather sit,” I replied, already collapsing into the nearest chair like rent was due.
His face didn’t smile.
But his eyes?
They definitely smirked.
And then—
Bulus stomped in.
Uniform sharp like it studied abroad.
Mouth? Already loaded.
“CEEQWINN. YOU’RE NOW AN ALPHALITE?!”
“Better be,” Prosper added, adjusting his designer collar like it owed him backpay.
“Or a WIFE,” someone whispered from the crowd.
Laughter broke out.
Angel gasped like she just heard a proposal.
I reached for my Envepad—
Gone.
Brooch? Missing.
Chest? Empty.
Desk? Checked.
Nothing.
Angel blinked.
“Didn’t you just—? Wait. What’s that?”

My Envepad.
One hiss.
One twitch.
And the thing LAUNCHED.
Smashed through the window.
Glass scattered. Screams everywhere.
Even Bulus cursed in capital letters.
I stood there. Frozen.
Every eye in the hall turned to me.
Including the Director’s — watching silently through the camera above the door.
Class went wild.
Chairs flying.
Voices shaking the roof.
And me?
Already running out the door.

Angel blink.
“But no be just now—? Wait. Wetin be dat?”

One hiss.
One small shake.

Glass scatter. People scream.

All the eyes inside hall face me.
