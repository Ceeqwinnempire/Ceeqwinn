      📘 CHAPTER 1 – “BETA TIMES AHEAD”

I was writing like the ceiling had 5 seconds to fall. Pen dragging across sparkly squared lines like I was attacking the paper. Click. Swipe. Scribble. My brooch blinking. My heart? Matching the rhythm like they could sense the end times.
Brooch? Check. Signature? Looking like I slashed my name with a sword. Vest and blouse? Tension combo. Like softness and stress had entered a tag-team match on my torso.
Even my flats were clenching.
Then? BOOM.
The hallway exploded.
Chairs squealed. Voices ping-ponged. Somebody yelled, “OMOOO!” like they just saw an ancestral ghost wearing Crocs.
I didn’t flinch. I tucked the curl behind my ear — the disrespectful one that always slithered out when things got dramatic. 
“Beta times ahead!”
The Director’s voice slammed through the room like he was trying to shake the floor tiles into repentance.
His kaftan shimmered like a solar eclipse. Crest golden. Eyes serious. Aura? Presidential meets prophet.
“Better times ahead!” he repeated, louder now, like the roof needed to hear it too.
I gave him side-eye lite. His face? A full suspense trailer with no subtitles.
“Thank God,” I muttered, sliding my stack of rainbow files to his side like I was handing him baby dragons.
“Give Him glory,” he replied, smiling like he just approved a destiny.
The man looked like ambition had gone for NYSC, came back, and opened a tech church. Kaftan razor-clean. Placket so calm it looked like it meditated. Movements like he had nowhere to go but still controlled the schedule.
He opened the drawer. One click.
Out came the card.
Gold. Flat. Deadly.
If thunder joined a boy band and became an accessory — this was it.
The Envepad.
Not just tech. It was status. Proof. Protection. A digital guardian angel with Wi-Fi.
My brooch flickered like it just saw its long-lost sibling.
I reached—
And that’s when it happened.
The noise. The rumble.
Outside? Full chaos mode. Voices? Louder than bargain-day in Yaba. Sounds like someone summoned extra wahala with Bluetooth connection.
The Director didn’t even blink.
“Your moment has come,” he said, sliding the Envepad into my hand like he just handed me the Infinity Gauntlet.
“The school is watching.”
Then he went back to reading files like he didn’t just give me a pass to destiny.
I stared at it.
The Envepad.
Inside: My future. My rank. My proof I belonged.
But before I could even hold a full breath—
RUMMMMBBLLEE.
The hallway sounded like thunder discovered Spotify.
I didn’t panic. I adjusted my collar.
Let them come.
________________________________________
The moment I stepped out the office—
A hand snatched me like I was the last jollof rice at a party.
"CEEQWINNNNNNNNN!!"
Angel Okon.
She came with sparkles. And danger. And perfume that could trigger fire alarms.
Anime sleeves flaring like she was about to cast a spell. High-waisted skirt doing the most. Beads rattling like her own sound effects team.
She didn’t walk. She ARRIVED. With vibes.
“Angel—what is it this time?” I asked, already regretting every decision that led me to this hallway.
She twirled. Then twirled again. Like a storm with glitter.
“YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT!” she gasped. Eyes wide like she saw school fees quadruple.
“What?”
She did one final spin for dramatic tension.
“THE BETAS!! THEY’RE PLAYING WARRRR IN BETA HALL!!”
I blinked. “You’re not even supposed to be—”
“I KNOW!!” she shrieked, full Gen Z hysteria activated. “But the scanner let me pass! It was the brooch! It blinked!”
She shoved it under my nose.
Silver. Flashy. Brooch the size of ambition.
“Emmanuel said I could borrow it. Just once,” she whispered. “To feel... elite-adjacent.”
I sighed. The brooch practically screamed Beta Hall access.
She yanked me like my arm owed her explanations.
I let her drag me.
Because Beta Hall? Was wide open.
Normally it was locked like family secrets. But today? The glass doors were open like drama had RSVP’d.
A crowd had gathered— staff, juniors, Essentials, one janitor who was definitely not mopping.
Cheering. Screaming. Losing their minds like it was a celebrity wedding.
“ANDERSON BLOCKED A MISSILE!” “CHYZYLYN IS FIGHTING IN HEELS!”
Even a drone hovered, catching the madness like it was a Netflix special.
Guards? Missing. Maybe hiding. Maybe praying.
Angel grinned like chaos owed her rent money.
“Let’s go na! Before they change their mind!”
I looked at the scanner beside the door.
Green. Still green. My brooch blinked softly.
No alarms. No rejection. Just that soft, silent permission.
Like Alterborne itself said: Let her in. She’s part of this madness.
I stepped forward. Beside Angel. Into the wild
Beta times ahead.
________________________________________

Beta Hall was wild.
The kind of wild that smelled like burnt wires, broken rules, and bold decisions. If chaos had a concert, this was the backstage pass.
A robot — six-foot-something of metal menace — lunged like it was collecting debts in instalments.
And the target?
Anderson.
Crisp black suit. Gold vest shining like he dressed for his own graduation and forgot his brain at home.
Tall. Polished. Dumb.
He squared up like fists could solve coding problems. Like he was auditioning for “Transformers: Lagos Drift.”
Students roared. Lights flashed. Laser grids danced across the ceiling like a DJ was controlling the building.
A robot dog chased a drone. The drone ran like it owed money. The dog barked in binary.
And in the eye of the storm?
One boy. One bot. One terrible idea.
Anderson ducked. The robot swung. BOOOOM.
A table flipped like it had heard enough.
Angel screamed beside me like someone paused her favorite telenovela.
“THIS IS STREET FIGHTER LEVEL 9000!!”
Me?
I sighed.
Because next to me?
Samuel Okon.
Sweater lazily tied across one shoulder. Fade sharp enough to slice yam. Aura? Smelled like sandalwood, old money, and academic judgment.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” he said.
“Yeah…” I started.
“…how the Betas always find a way to make it about them,” he finished, voice steady like tea without sugar.
And then she appeared.
Chyzylyn.
If martial arts met runway fashion in a spicy anime remix — she’d be the poster.
One thigh out. One pleat down. Boots like thunder.
Skirt? Flared like it had a personal fan. Eyes? Sharp. Movement? Slice.
She didn’t enter. She attacked.
SPIN — WHAM! Elbow to the bot’s jaw.
SWIPE — BOOT! Anderson kicked the robot’s leg.
The crowd screamed like the group chat just dropped a leaked test.
And then—
ZzzRRT!
The robot’s red eye spun, detached mid-air like a spiritual USB stick and flew—
Straight. At. My. Face.
“CEEQWINNN DUCKKKK!!!” Angel screamed.
I didn’t duck.
I twisted.
The eye grazed my curls like it was testing my shampoo, then smacked a desk with a THUD that smelled like burnt jollof and regret.
I blinked.
Angel gasped beside me. “IF I DIE HERE, TELL MY MOTHER I DIED WITH FINE HAIR!!”
Silence.
Samuel stepped forward. Didn’t shout. Didn’t flinch.
“Envepad override,” he said, tapping his brooch. “Class: Samuel. Rank: Alpha.”
The walls responded like obedient househelps.
“Combat protocol override. Stand down.”
And just like that…
The robot froze.
Anderson lay wheezing on the floor like he’d just fought destiny.
Chyzylyn flicked her braid like the battle didn’t touch her.
The crowd erupted into whispers.
Samuel turned to me.
“Still standing?”
“I’d rather sit,” I muttered, already falling into the nearest chair like rent was due.
His face didn’t smile. But his eyes? They smirked.
And just then—
Bulus stomped in.
Uniform? Pressed like it studied in Cambridge. Mouth? Already loaded.
“CEEQWINN. YOU’RE NOW AN ALPHALITE?”
“Better be,” Prosper chimed, flicking his designer collar like it owed him rent.
“Or a WIFE,” someone whispered.
Laughter.
Angel gasped like someone just proposed.
I reached for my Envepad—
Gone.
Brooch? Missing. Chest? Empty. Desk? Checked.
Nothing.
Angel blinked. “Didn’t you just—? Wait. What’s that?”
We turned.
The robot’s eye — now blinking like low battery — began to unfold.
Legs.
Tiny. Creepy. Mechanical.
Inside it?
My Envepad.
One hiss.
One twitch.
And the thing LAUNCHED.
Smashed through the window.
Glass shattered. Screams. Even Bulus cursed in capital letters.
I stood frozen.
Every eye in the hall turned to me.
Including the Director’s — watching silently from the camera feed above the door.
Class erupted.
Chairs flying. Voices booming.
And me?
Already running out the door.
