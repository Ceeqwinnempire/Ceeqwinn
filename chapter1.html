    <h1>📖 Chapter 1: Glitter and Secrets</h1>

    <p>For the fourth time in a row, I scribbled my initials inside the sparkly squares like my life depended on it — and then boom. The hallway exploded.</p>
    <p>Chairs screeched. Voices rose. Somebody actually screamed “Omo!” like we were in a movie.</p>
    <p>I flinched, snapped my head toward the chaos, and instinctively dusted glitter off my holographic sleeve dress with crystal cuffs, my fingers twitching like they had minds of their own.</p>
    <p>I locked eyes with the madness for half a second… then rolled them, snatched my focus back, and kept writing.</p>
    <p>“Better times ahead!” The Director’s voice thundered through the office like a motivational speaker who overdosed on confidence.</p>
    <p>I side-eyed him. His face was doing that thing again — half pride, half suspense thriller.</p>
    <p>“Thank God,” I muttered, sliding the rainbow-colored files toward his side of the desk like I was handing over state secrets.</p>
    <p>“Give Him glory,” he beamed, stretching his hand toward me like a magician unveiling a prophecy. A golden card glinted between his fingers.</p>
